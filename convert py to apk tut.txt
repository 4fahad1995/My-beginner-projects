How to convert .py to .apk using kivy or kivymd:

1)Create a .py file called 'main.py'.

2)Write your code in your 'main.py' file and save it.

3)Now open Google colaboratory.

4)Inside the code editor you need to write these pre-defined codes one-by-one:
  (these codes are used to create Linux virtual environment)

  !pip install buildozer

  !pip install cython

  !sudo apt-get install -y \
	python3-pip \
	build-essential \
	git \
	python3 \
	python3-dev \
	ffmpeg \
	libsdl2-dev \
	libsdl2-image-dev \
	libsdl2-mixer-dev \
	libsdl2-ttf-dev \
	libportmidi-dev \
	libswscale-dev \
	libavformat-dev \
	libavcodec-dev \
	zlib1g-dev

!sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
bzip2 libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev openssl libgdbm-dev
libgdbm-compat-dev libzma-dev libreadline-dev libncursesw5-dev
libffi-dev uuid-dev libffi6

!sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

5)After running these codes you need to import your 'main.py' file
  into session storage.You can find the option in files section.

6)After uploading the file you need to run this code which will run buildozer
  virual environment and create 'buildozer.spec' file:

  !buildozer init 

7)Open 'buildozer.spec' file and modify these lines to avoid 
  crashing during runtime and our app gets created successfully
   
  i)Go to line 37,Application requirements and there you need to write
    'kivy==2.0.0,kivymd,pillow' and save it.
    (pillow is used for image processing) 

8)Finally, write this code to convert our .py file into .apk:
  
  !buildozer android debug deploy run

9)After packaging is done, you can find the .apk file in the 'bin'
  folder. All you have to do is download the file into your phone
  and it wil run.
